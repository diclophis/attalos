# Attalos

![image](attalos.png)

A modern real-time platform for online discussion built with GNU Make, XMPP, Stanza.io, React, Browserify, as an static isomorphic javascript web application with a messaging back-end.

# Separation of services

This application is split into 2 main categories:

* ## front-end
   
  The front-end of attalos is a static single page application built primarily with the react platform. The main component diagram is as follows:
   
      <Index>
        <Attalos>
          <Connect />
          <Room />
        </Attalos>
      </Index>

  ### Theory of Routing

     You can use queryString params with static files...

      /rooms/123 => ?id=123&controller=rooms&action=index

     If sufficient server resources exist, mapping from URL pathInfo => queryString is trivial

     Thus, state should be managed soley by the values in queryString (and enhanced via more direct url aliases)

     Page navigation occurs when the state of the queryString changes, BUT queryString URLs are views of the state itself

     State should be fetched via the history api

* ## back-end
   
   The back-end of the attalos is several servers each with a specific duty

    * CHAT
    
      Primary Messaging Bus, based on `XMPP`, allowing for both `c2s` and `s2s` operation 

    * WEB
    
	    Serves resources under the `public/*` directory over HTTP with `express`
	  
    * BOSH
    
      Legacy networking adapter for enhanced client compatibility

# Where to start

This project uses `make` to coordinate all aspects of its development, the primary targets of interest are:

 * dev
 * clean
 * all
 * check
 * dist

Source of both client and server logic is only in this repo

* src/javascripts
* src/stylesheets

The `build` products are placed in `public/` it is possible to self-host these files as long as you provide your own `BOSH` and `CHAT` servers!

## Local Development

    bundle
    DEFAULT_XMPP_PORT=5100 DEFAULT_BOSH_HOST=localhost DEFAULT_BOSH_PORT=5200 foreman start

## Build your own docker image (think federations based on domain over a cluster of servers)

    vagrant up
    ansible-playbook -i ansible/attalos.inventory ansible/attalos-playbook.yml

This will produce a `620M` docker image at `~/precise.tar`

    open http://10.0.30.11:5000/dev.html
